    let omukText = `Hey! Thank you for stopping by to check out my Indiegogo campaign. I’m a 100% independent artist and a Big Dreamer who loves creating music and more! My New Album is dedicated to all of you who are making our world a better place in your own way! To you who have chosen the tougher path of doing good, instead of the easy opposite. I wholeheartedly believe that seemingly small, good actions hold our world together and are Heroic! You are Heroes for that!  :) ❤️
    Your participation in making this indie project a success will prove that we can make it on our own with No middlemen, no labels! We’ve Got the Power! (in the words of ‘Snap!’ hah) :D
    I cannot wait for you to join me on this Superheroic journey! Your pledge means the world to me. Let’s bring this new Album & Superheroine to Life, together! ✨

    Growing up in a village and tiny society in the shadows of Mount Olympus in Greece, it seemed I couldn't connect to much at all. I often say that “music saved me”. I truly believe it did. I grew up in a household of domestic violence where hurt and pain were “normal” to witness for years. By singing and listening to music, I was coming alive and felt electric! Music was my haven amid chaos.
    I was a Big Dreamer but while growing up my confidence was stripped away due to the harmful situation at home and years of bullying at school.My confidence actually grew a lot in 2020, after my successful, first-ever crowdfunding campaign for my debut album, THANKS TO YOU who supported it!! You enabled me to believe that what I do counts and it makes a difference in the world!
    Will you also help me this time around to launch my 2nd album & bring our Superheroine ‘Harmonia’ into the world?
